* [Swift error handling in practice](http://www.sunsetlakesoftware.com/2015/06/12/swift-2-error-handling-practice)
  goes over how Objective-C errors were handled with code examples then 
  explains how Swift 2's error handling differs.

## `guard` Statement
The `guard` statement is Swift 2 syntax for positively checking an error
condition and escaping from the immediate control flow, such as the current
function.

* The answer to this Stack Overflow 
  [question on the guard statement](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/30791488/swift-2-guard-keyword)
  concisely describes how guards can unwrap optionals and exit from a block
  when conditions are not met, instead of having to use nested if-else 
  statements.
